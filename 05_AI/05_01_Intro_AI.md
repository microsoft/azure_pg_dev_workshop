# 05 / Intro to Artificial Intelligence (AI)

## HistoryDespite the overwhelming hype generated recently by the announcement of new Generative AI models (which we will discuss in the next few sections), the technology has been decades in the making. The first AI research efforts date back to 1960s!

During the 1990s several applications of statistical approaches were made with text analysis. New algorithms emerged and were commonly called machine learning (ML). These algorithms were able to learn patterns from data, without being explicitly programmed for specific tasks. These new approaches allowed for a computer to simulate human language understanding. Statistical models were trained on text-label pairings, which then enabled the models to classify unknown input text with a pre-defined label representing the intention of the message.

Today, we are now in a time where AIs have human cognitive capabilities, like the conversations that are possible with OpenAI ChatGPT or Bing Chat. Before OpenAI, the very first prototypes of AI consisted of simplistic chatbots that relied on knowledge bases of indexed information. Answers in the knowledge base were discovered by keywords appearing in the input text and thusly in the knowledge bases.

Due to the technological evolution of hardware paired with more advanced algorithms, computers are now capable of handling incredibly large amounts of data using even more complex computations. As these models were further studied and improved upon, a new class of machine learning algorithms emerged called neural networks or deep learning algorithms.

Neural networks significantly enhanced natural language processing. These new algorithms provided a path to represent the meaning of text in a more meaningful way. In essence, valuing the context of a word in a sentence.

It is these new algorithms trained on very large sets of data that now drive the virtual assistants many people are familiar with. These agents have become very proficient in interpreting the human language, identifying a need, and performing an action to achieve the stated goal(s).
